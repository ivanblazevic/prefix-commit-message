# Prefix Commit Message

This script is meant to be used with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) as a [prepare-commit-msg Git hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_prepare_commit_msg).
Each time you commit, it extracts the issue identifier or user-story identifier from the current branch name and prefixes your commit message with the extracted identifier.

It supports identifiers of the form `ABCD-1234` and `1234`, and will look for such identifiers right after the `/` in the name of the current branch.
If you're on the branch `feature/JIRA-874-cannot-login-on-macos`, for example, this hook will prefix each of your commit messages with `[ JIRA-874 ]`.

There are simpler shell scripts that achieve the same, but this solution works on Windows too.

## Installation

First, install [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky):

```
npm install husky --save-dev
```

Then, install this hook:

```
npm install prefix-commit-message --save-dev
```

Finally, add the following to `package.json`:

```
"husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "prepare-commit-msg": "prefix-commit-message"
    }
  }
```

## Custom prefix

Pass JS snippet (which will be evaluated during the runtime) in single quotes as configuration param to override default prefix structure:

For example:

"prepare-commit-msg": "prefix-commit-message '`${identifier}` '"

Will produce commit message: `JIRA-874 cannot-login-on-macos`
